    		<h4>Description of the organization and information system</h4>
	</section>
	<div class="text-box">
	<h5> Organization Background:</h5>
	<p> <a href="https://poemuseum.org/">The Poe Museum </a> was first established in 1906, in Richmond, Virginia as part of the Poe Memorial Association’s effort to erect a monument for <a href="https://poemuseum.org/edgar-allan-	poe/">Edgar Allan Poe </a>  in the late author’s hometown.<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vinueza0923/Final/main/Edgar-Allan-Poe.jpg"alt="PoePortrait"style="border:2px solid #7a002b;	margin:10px; float: right; width:386px; height:450px;" />  It was created by James Howard Whitty, a 	Poe scholar and collector of his memorabilia (at the time of his death, he was the owner of the world’s largest collection 	of Poe’s works) along with Archer and Annie Jones. In 1922, the Poe Shrine, a building built from the 	remains of the Southern Literary Messenger building, where Poe worked as an editor and was “the birthplace of Poe’s career 	in journalism,” opened to the public. The Shrine was later renamed to the Poe Museum. The Poe Museum’s mission statement is as follows: "Our mission, illuminating Poe for everyone, evermore." The museum strives to achieve this 	mission "by 	interpreting the world's largest collection of Poe memorabilia, ephemera, and artifacts." 	They offer educational tours for people of all ages along with educational 	resources for teachers to help spread Poe’s 	word. 	Additional services include professional development workshops, student art and writing contests, and 	“Unhappy Hours” that feature food and music once a month from April 	through October.</p>
	
	<h5>Website Overview:</h5>
		<p>The website encourages users to explore The Poe Museum, primarily by inviting them to visit in person, but they also have an online collection. The main page features an image of the museum gardens, along with a 			button that says “plan your visit.” The main page itself has various sections that are revealed as you scroll including, "Welcome to The Poe Museum," "Who is Edgar Allan Poe?," and "Our Events," as well as introductions 		to "Our Collection" (which highlights a collection item, the engagement ring Poe gave to Elmira Royster Shelton) and "Our Blog." The home page’s header is divided into nine sections that take you to other parts of the 		website. The “Visit +” header includes a drop down menu with the “plan a visit” and the “our events” subpages. The “Edgar Allan Poe” header takes you to a biography of Poe himself. At the bottom of this page there is a 		link to a complete list of Poe’s complete works, complete with hyperlinks to each work. This page is the only place on the website where you can access Poe’s complete works.</p>
		<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vinueza0923/Final/main/Website Overview.png"alt="Websiteoverview"style="border:2px solid #7a002b; max-width:65%; height:auto;display:block; margin-left:auto;              				margin-right:auto;" />

		
		<p> “The Museum” page is the first place where you can 		find the museum’s mission statement: “Our mission, illuminating Poe for everyone, evermore.” It includes a history of the museum, the building it resides 		in, the historical Poe shrine, and the surrounding garden. In 		addition to this historical background information, it also provides information about the museum’s mascots: their resident cats. The “Learn +” 		header has a drop down menu containing the following subpages: school 			groups, adult groups, educator resources, and our blog. The “Our Blog” section of the header is the other place you can find Poe’s 		literature, since all of it was posted onto the blog to get it on the website. Similarly, 		the “Support +” page also has subpages, with information on how to rent the museum for events, as well as internship 		and volunteer opportunities. The “shop” page allows you to purchase a variety of Poe-based memorabilia 		including books on, by, or adjacent to Poe, vaguely gothic jewelry, and all kinds of trinkets referencing 		his poetry and short stories. Both the “donate” and “become a member” pages allow users to support the museum 		monetarily either through annual memberships that grant people free admission to the museum and 		access to exclusive museum content, or simply donate money when they see fit.
		The “Collections” page has some brief information regarding the museum’s collection of Poe artifacts, their library, and the research they do. On this page there is an “explore more” link that opens up the museum’s 			digitized collection of Poe memorabilia and archival material in a new tab. We will explore this section of the website further in the next section.</p>

    		<h4>Evaluation of existing information system</h4>
	</section>
	<div class="text-box">
		<h5>Cataloging System:</h5>
			<p>The Poe Museum’s online collection is a searchable database of Poe’s possessions, manuscripts, letters, ephemera, and more.</p>
			<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vinueza0923/Final/main/Poecollection.png"alt="collectionpage"style="border:2px solid #7a002b;			width:65%; height:auto;display:block; margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;" />

<h5>Organization:</h5>
			<p>The collections are divided into subcategories in a few different places on the website. The main collections page highlights Poe’s letters and manuscripts, possessions, portraits, first editions, items from 			his home, and the Susan Jaffe Tane collection. The header also breaks up the collection into archives, library, objects, photos, exhibits, people, and “random images.”</p>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vinueza0923/Final/main/PoeCohead.png"alt="poecollecheading"style="border:2px solid #7a002b;			width:65%; height:auto;display:block; margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;" />
<p> While browsing items from the collections 			(with the exception of the “random images” page) each item’s catalog number appears below its title. They are formatted in the same way search results are, with a search box at the top (so users can search within 			each section), in list format, with a preview image on the left. It’s not a continuous scroll, so if there are more results, users can click to the next page once they get to the bottom of the screen. The “random 			images” page is organized a bit differently. The results appear in a grid format, with only an image and title (no catalog number). Additionally, while every time you search or look at a specific collection, the 			results appear in the same order, each time a user clicks the “random images” page a new set of results appears. This is what makes the page truly “random.”</p>

			<p>Once a user clicks on an item, the amount of information provided on each item’s page differs from item to item (which we will address in our critical analysis section), but generally includes the title, 				object 	name, catalog number, date, collection, and people. Search results draw on information from all of these categories.</p> 
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vinueza0923/Final/main/Random images.png
"alt="random"style="border:2px solid #7a002b;			width:65%; height:auto;display:block; margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;" />		

<h5>Searching:</h5>
			<p>There are two search pages within the collection’s website: keyword search and advanced search. The keyword search page has a search box along with a small number of filters users can apply. This “records to 			include” section allows users to include objects, photos, archival material, library material, and only records with images in their search. Additionally, there is a search tip under these filters that prompts 			users to use Boolean operators and keyword search terms, using plain language. The advanced search page includes the same information as the keyword search page, with the ability to include people and containers 			in their filters. Users can also include additional information in multiple search boxes which include the catalog number, collection, creator, date, description, object name, people, search terms, and title.</p> 

			<p>Overall, the search feature is optimized for users who are familiar with Boolean operators and other search strategies that are traditionally used in library and academic spaces. Search results that do not use 			these search strategies do not pull relevant information (see the images of the search results for The Bells vs “The Bells”). In order to set users up for success with their searches, not only do both search 			pages have short descriptions on how to use Boolean operators, but the main page of the collection website includes a more in-depth “tips for searching” section. This explains the difference between the two 				search pages and the different collections (random images, archives, people, etc) users can limit their searches to.</p>

	<section class="part-box">
    		<h4>Critical analysis of the organization's information systems and Recommendations</h4>
	</section>
	<div class="text-box">
		<h5> Project objectives/scope:</h5>
			<p>The objective of this critical analysis of the Poe Museum’s website is to improve the user interface for the museum’s collections database.</p>
		<h5> Guidelines for analysis:</h5>
			<p>For our analysis of the information system, we will be rooting our critiques in the HCI guidelines. To limit the amount of overlapping information, our analysis will not be structured using the guidelines 			exactly, but we will reference them throughout our analysis. Instead, our analysis will outline key issues we found in our research followed by recommendations that we could propose.</p>
		<h5> Issue 1: Locating items in the Collections </h5>
			<h6>Interaction Efficiency:</h6>
			<p>In general, user interactions with the website are efficient when seeking basic information about the museum and its collections. Tasks typically require a combination of four or fewer actions, i.e. clicking, 			scrolling, and/or typing. For example, to view an item in the collections, which comprises images of objects, manuscripts, and photos, the user starts on the home page and clicks on the heading "Collections." On 			the collections page, under "Our Collections," the user clicks on "Explore More." Finally, by clicking on a heading, a featured image, or an image's corresponding title, the user generates a list of relevant 			results from which they can select an item to view.</p>

			<p>While the site can be classified as efficient, many features are not intuitive, thus leading to confusion and potential frustration when a user wants to view specific items. As previously mentioned, when 				visiting the collections page, the user encounters multiple subcategories—six categories are prominently displayed with images, and seven categories are indicated in the header. However, upon further exploration, 			the subcategories are not discrete; the significance of numerous items within the categories is unclear; and to a non-expert, the organization is seemingly random, with the lists of items based on archival record 			numbers.</p>

			<p>Additionally, the catalog’s search boxes are optimized for Boolean searches. Searches that are made without Boolean operators yield results that are most likely irrelevant to users. To mitigate this issue, the 			museum has a tips page on the collections’ home page, which outlines how to use Boolean operators. This information is also repeated on the keyword and advanced search pages. That said, these tips sections don’t 			actually provide a lot of helpful information on what Boolean operators are and how to use them for users who have never heard of them before. Moreover, the tips section on the home page is at the bottom of the 			page, under the main collections section, removed from all of the actual search boxes.</p>

			<h6>Navigation:</h6>
			<p>Most strikingly, Poe's writings are difficult to find--the user only discovers them by chance while browsing the site. If the user has had previous experience exploring the site and knows where to find Poe's 			written works, navigating to the page is nonetheless inefficient, requiring a series of five actions, alternating between clicking and scrolling. Starting on the home page, the user clicks on "Edgar Allan Poe," 			scrolls to the bottom of the resulting page to "Poe's Complete Works," and clicks on "Read More." On the next page, the user scrolls through the lists of Poe's writings, displayed in two columns, then clicks on a 			link to view the full text; all but one of the works are reproduced and accessed in the museum blog. Each blog post includes a title and duplicates of an illustration followed by text. Some of the blog posts 			begin by adding a truncated version of the text in extra large font. It is important to note that no part of the "Collections" includes Poe's writings, and there is no mechanism to perform a search of Poe’s 				written works on the site.</p>

				<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vinueza0923/Final/main/Bellcollection.png"alt="bellcollection"style="border:2px solid #7a002b;width:55%; height:auto;display:block; margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;"/>
			<p style="text-align:center;font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:18px;color:#1a1a1a;margin-left:15%;margin-right:15%;"> In this scenario, we searched for “The Bells” in the collection page. We couldn’t find the actual poem; instead, we found the book in which it appears.</p>
	
			<p style="text-align:center;font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:24px;color:#470012;text-decoration: underline;font-weight:bold;margin-left:15%;margin-right:15%;margin-bottom: 30px;"> View from Edgar Allan Poe page</p>
			<p style="text-align:left;font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:24px;color:#470012;font-weight:bold;margin-left:15%;margin-right:15%;margin-bottom: 30px;"> Step:1</p>
			<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vinueza0923/Final/main/edgarpoebio.png"alt="edgar poe bio"style="border:2px solid #7a002b;width:55%; height:auto;display:block; margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;"/>
			<p style="text-align:center;font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:18px;color:#1a1a1a;margin-left:15%;margin-right:15%;"> First, we had to click the "Edgar Allan Poe" tag in home page. This image shows Edgar Allan Poe's page.</p>

			<p style="text-align:left;font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:24px;color:#470012;font-weight:bold;margin-left:15%;margin-right:15%;margin-bottom: 30px;"> Step:2</p>
			<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vinueza0923/Final/main/scroll down.png"alt="scroll down"style="border:2px solid #7a002b;width:55%; height:auto;display:block; margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;"/>
			<p style="text-align:center;font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:18px;color:#1a1a1a;margin-left:15%;margin-right:15%;"> The next step: We had to scroll all the way down and there is an option that says Poe's Complete Works "Click to see a list of Edgar Allan Poe’s complete works."</p>

			<p style="text-align:left;font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:24px;color:#470012;font-weight:bold;margin-left:15%;margin-right:15%;margin-bottom: 30px;"> Step:3</p>
			<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vinueza0923/Final/main/mainpageofpoem.png"alt="poems page"style="border:2px solid #7a002b;width:55%; height:auto;display:block; margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;"/>
			<p style="text-align:center;font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:18px;color:#1a1a1a;margin-left:15%;margin-right:15%;"> After we clicked, we were taken to the Poe's Complete Works. His works are divided into two sections: short stories or poems. We looked for "The Bells."</p>

			<p style="text-align:left;font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:24px;color:#470012;font-weight:bold;margin-left:15%;margin-right:15%;margin-bottom: 30px;"> Step:4</p>
			<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vinueza0923/Final/main/the poem.png"alt="the bells"style="border:2px solid #7a002b;width:55%; height:20%;display:block; margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;"/>
			<p style="text-align:center;font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:18px;color:#1a1a1a;margin-left:15%;margin-right:15%;"> After we clicked, we were finally taken to the actual poem.</p>






			


			

			<h6>Recommendations:</h6>
			<p>We recommend simplifying the collections pages to facilitate searching for items. This can be achieved by:</p>
				<ol style=text-align:left;font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:22px;color:#1a1a1a;margin-left:15%;margin-right:15%;">
					<li>Creating a page exclusively for the collections and relocating information about the library, research, and image licensing to a separate page.</li>
					<li>Consolidating items into fewer categories.</li>
					<li>Moving the "Tips for searching" to the collections page and clarifying the instructions.</li>
					<li>Adding Poe’s written works to the collections catalog and making them searchable like items in the current collections.</li>
					<li>Ensuring that all of Poe's writings are presented in a consistent and simplified format--with the title and a single illustration followed by the complete text.</li>
				</ol>
		
		<h5> Issue 2: Organization of item records</h5>
			<p>As previously mentioned, the overall organization of items in the collections is based on archival record numbers–an unfamiliar system to many users. Furthermore, items frequently require further investigation 				to uncover their relevance to Poe. On the "People" pages, for example, photos of individuals are accompanied by names and dates without any indication of how they are connected to Poe. To add to the 					confusion, the significance of dates is only understood after clicking on an item and viewing its full record. The collection entries are also inconsistent in how they are tagged. For example, a DVD of 				Stephen King’s “Children of the Corn” appears under “random images.” It does not list its relevance to Poe in its description. Moreover, the DVD cannot be found by filtering by people, when you search for 				Stephen King (the book’s author) or Fritz Kierch (the movie’s director). </p>
			<h6>Recommendations:</h6>
			<p>We recommend employing an organizational system that is familiar to all users, is easily searchable, and clearly displays information linking the items to Poe. This can be achieved by: </p>
				<ol style=text-align:left;font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:22px;color:#1a1a1a;margin-left:15%;margin-right:15%;">
					<li>Organizing records alphabetically by title as the default system.</li>
					<li>Improving the website's search engine capabilities.</li>
					<li>Including the relevance of items to Poe on the main collections pages--to accompany the item's image and title.</li>
					<li>Following the conventional use of birth and death dates.</li>
				</ol>
		

		<h5> Issue 3: Communication and establishing the user's trust </h5>
			<h6>Response time</h6>
			<p>In terms of communication, the website does pretty well. The response time is quite quick (although, when the user is required to wait briefly, it is difficult to spot the loading indicator, a small spinning 			circle inside the tab at the top of the page. There is no other indication to the user that the site is busy working). The pages are also generally easy to read, since they’re not overloaded with images or “high 			volume media” (Oh, 2025).</p>

			<h6>Establishing trust</h6>
<p>One major issue we found while examining the website was that it was hard to find any information about the history and background of the museum itself. While there is an “about us” section, it’s not labeled as such (which goes against what most websites do). Instead, the history of the museum can be found in two different subpages of the website, the “plan a visit” and “the visit” pages. While the subpage “plan a visit” gives some brief information on where the museum is located, its mission statement, and what attractions the museum houses, more detailed information on the museum’s founding and history can be found under “the museum.” Although this page details the history of the museum, the way in which it conveys the information is incredibly confusing. It lists several different dates and places for the museum (for instance, this page says it was established in 1906, but the “plan a visit page” says it was established in 1922). As we mentioned in our overview of the organization, 1906 seems to be the year when people tried (and failed) to build a monument for Poe, while 1922 was the year the Poe Shrine opened. From the wording of the website, it’s unclear how the failed monument, the shrine, and the museum are all connected.</p> 

<p>Moreover, there’s very little biographical information regarding the museum’s founder James Howard Whitty, and the “group of literary enthusiasts" he worked with. The information included earlier in our overview was found using resources outside the website itself, illustrating how little information regarding the museum could be found on its website. In addition to their poor depiction of the history of the museum, there’s virtually no information on who currently runs the museum aside from an “our team” page that resides in the footer. This simply lists the names and roles of the museum’s employees, but does not give a substantive look into who these people are or what they do for the museum. The lack of information could result in users not trusting the website as much, since they haven’t done much to establish users’ trust. This lack of trust is underscored by the inconsistencies in copyright between the main website and the catalog. The main page is copyrighted for 2025, while the catalog says 2022, leaving the impression that the collections catalog hasn’t been updated in at least three years.</p>

<p>That said, they do make it fairly easy to contact the institution itself, since they list their contact information (including their address, email, and phone number) in the footer that appears on every page. It does appear that those are the only interaction mechanisms the website has, since there’s no chat or general FAQ section (there is an FAQ section, but that is specifically for people trying to buy tickets, rather than for the website/catalog as a whole).</p>

<p>The website overall, appears to be secure, security-wise. There is a “privacy policy” page in the footer disclosing what information they collect, why they collect it, how they use that information, and what security procedures they have to protect users’ information. There is also a “Privacy - Terms” pop-up in the bottom right corner of the page. It follows you regardless of what page you are on. It just tells you you are “protected by reCAPTCHA.” This feature is only on the main website, not the collections page.</p>

			<h6>Recommendations:</h6>
			<p>To improve the website’s communication, we recommend that they add some kind of loading bar or other graphic to indicate to users when the website is more visible to the user. 
			In terms of establishing trust, we recommend they:</p>
			<ol style=text-align:left;font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:22px;color:#1a1a1a;margin-left:15%;margin-right:15%;">
				<li>Add an “about us” page detailing who currently owns and runs the museum, with more information on its founders.</li>
				<li>Include a timeline on the building and founding of the museum.</li>
				<li>Add a bit more information on their “the museum” page to illustrate how the failed Poe monument, the Poe Shrine, and the contemporary museum are all connected.</li>
			</ol>

		<h5>Issue 4: Readability and accessibility</h4>
			<h6>Multiculturality</h6>
			<p>Although the website attempts to highlight how the museum itself is accessible (for those visiting in person) through an accessibility section on their “visit us” page, the Poe Museum does not actively 				advertise any accessibility features on their website. The only feature we could find is the “alt text” that is used for all of the images on the website. </p>


<p>Another area of accessibility that is important to note is multiculturality. The website is only available in English, and there are no translation options available. A common symbol used throughout the website (particularly in their logo) is the raven. This is because of Poe’s famous poem “The Raven.” Since the museum is dedicated to Poe, it is assumed that users would be familiar with his work (or at least his most famous pieces), however, that assumption might alienate users who are new to Poe or are unfamiliar with the cultural symbols he created (such as non-American users). Moreover, while the website doesn’t use an over-expressive color palette, the use of black, white, and red is consistent with Western symbols of the gothic and macabre, reflecting the genre and tone of Poe’s writing. That said, that symbolism might not resonate with users unacquainted with Western symbolism.</p>
	
			<h6>Color</h6>
<p>In terms of the website’s use of color, its simple and minimalistic color palette makes the site easy to read, while not using any “extreme hues” (Oh, 2025). That said, while the simplicity of the black, white, and dark red could make the text easy to read, their use of these colors isn’t intuitive. Although it is within the color scheme, on the page with Poe’s collected works, once a user visits a link, the text for that poem/short story turns white. Since the background is cream, it is nearly impossible to see the text. In addition to being unreadable, this also goes against industry standards, which tend to turn the text purple.</p>
<p> Similarly, the collections catalog breaks from the museum’s color scheme, using purple instead of red. The use of purple is inconsistent with the rest of the museum’s website and goes against the aforementioned industry standard of using purple to indicate that the user has already visited a page. Since the initial text on the collection’s site is purple, some users may think that they’ve visited links that they haven’t. This issue could be further exacerbated by the fact that the text doesn’t change color when a user has viewed a collection item (nor is there any other way for users to know when they’ve already viewed a particular piece or page).</p>

			<h6>Text Layout</h6>
<p>As explored in our navigation section, one striking issue we found with the Poe Museum’s website is that the link to the collections database is incredibly hard to find. In addition to this navigation issue, the text for the link (which reads “Explore More” on the “Our Collections” page) is incredibly small and is situated in a strange place (above the top right corner of an image of a pocket knife). The small text and weird placement make the link to the collections page both hard to find and easy to miss. Moreover, “Explore More” doesn’t explicitly indicate that it is the link to the collections catalog, which could be confusing to some users.</p>

<p>Another layout issue we found, is that when a user looks at a page and their browser is not in full-screen mode, the text overlaps with the images and headings that are above it. This means that the text is only optimized for full-screen users. However, the issue does not occur when looking at the website on a mobile device. </p>

<p>There are also major text layout issues on the subpage for “Poe's Complete Works.” The same issue we found with the “Explore More” button on the collections page is also present on the page “Edgar Allan Poe.” The page is formatted in two columns with Poe’s short stories in one column and his poems in the other. While lists are centered under the title headings “Short Stories” and “Poems,” there is no differentiation between the titles of each work aside from their form. Additionally, the text for these lists is quite small. As a result, despite the list format, the text looks like one big block of text that is hard to read and navigate. </p>

<h6>Readability</h6>
<p>One readability issue we noticed is that the website goes against the Nielsen recommended convention of using sans-serif fonts exclusively for websites. Instead, this site combines serif with sans-serif, creating a cluttered effect that makes text hard to read. As previously mentioned, the text can be quite small in various parts of the website. There is no accessibility feature that would address this issue by allowing users to change the font or text size. </p>

<h6>Recommendations:</h6>
<p>We recommend that the Museum increase their overall accessibility by:</p>
	<ol style=text-align:left;font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:22px;color:#1a1a1a;margin-left:15%;margin-right:15%;">
		<li>Adding accessibility features (or at least making them more visible if they have them).</li>
		<li>Making the collections catalog bigger and in a different color (perhaps a button in the same red they use for the rest of the website).</li>
		<li>While the color scheme for the collections is cohesive, it does not match that of the main page. For continuity’s sake, we suggest that they use the same red that they use on the main page instead of purple.</li>
		<li>Instead of using white to indicate that a user previously visited a link, they should use purple (even though it technically doesn’t match the color scheme) so it would both be consistent with other websites and the text would be easier to read.</li>
</ol>

<h5>Conclusion</h5>
<p>Overall, based on our analysis of The Poe Museum’s website and collections catalog, we determined that the website is best suited for people who are familiar with traditional, academic sources. We found four main issues within the website: it’s hard to locate items in the collections database; the organization of records is inconsistent and not approachable to people unfamiliar with museum collections; the website does little to initiate communication with users nor does it do much to establish users’ trust; and there are many aspects of the website that make it inaccessible and hard to read for many users. These issues are most likely present because the website is optimized for users who have at least a basic understanding of Boolean operators and database searching. While many educators and academics are surely interested in the museum, this limited view of their audience goes against their mission statement "Our mission, illuminating Poe for everyone, evermore,” which emphasizes the fact that their museum (and therefore their website) is for everyone, regardless of their age or educational background. The other issues we found mostly had to do with a lack of consistency throughout the website and the collections page, which could make navigating the website difficult for many users, regardless of their background. By making their website more accessible for all users and ensuring there is consistency throughout their website, The Poe Museum would be more aligned with their stated goals.  </p>
